# Predicting Customer Churn using Machine Learning

The objective of this project is to compare the performance of different machine learning models: **Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Voting/Stacking Model Ensembling** in predicting Customer Churn in a telecommunications company using the dataset [JB Link Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnflag/jb-link-telco-customer-churn/data).

For greater detail and understanding of the observed behaviors, **8 different architectures of each model** were trained and evaluated following the **10-fold cross-validation technique**. Additionally, to illustrate how training data quality and quantity can influence the performance of machine learning algorithms, **4 different approaches to the dataset** were carried out using various techniques of **variable normalization**, dimensionality reduction with **PCA**, and feature selection by studying **correlations** with the target variable.

Finally, an approach and a model are selected to perform the **final model training** based on the best results obtained. This decision considers both the **performance** of the model and the **dimensionality reduction** and interpretability of the data used.

Please note that the development of this project was limited to the scope of an academic exercise. As such, the project has not undergone further refinement or optimization beyond this point.
